## Reloaded themes

A collection of themes (only dark at the moment) designed to use extended styles provided by C/C++ Reloaded extension.

NOTE: This is a beta-theme, it's still adjusted from time to time to make it better. It's planned to have more color variations in the future, however, before the 'Reloaded C/C++' extension is stabilized it will provide only the dark theme.
